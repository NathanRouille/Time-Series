# Time Series Analysis: Practical Notebook 

This repository contains a consolidated Jupyter Notebook that combines three distinct lab works on time series analysis. Each lab explores a specific aspect of time series modeling and estimation, utilizing theoretical concepts and practical implementation. Below is a brief overview of each lab and the skills applied:

## Lab 1: Estimation of Second-Order Moments
- **Objective**: Explore the estimation of theoretical and empirical mean and autocovariance for random processes, and compare them using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).
- **Key Topics**: 
  - Random processes: White Noise, AR processes, and Harmonic processes.
  - Autocovariance estimation and comparison.
- **Skills Applied**: 
  - Implementation of statistical estimators.
  - Use of Python for numerical computation and visualization.
  - Analysis of variance and convergence properties of estimators.

## Lab 2: Power Spectral Density Estimation
- **Objective**: Develop estimators for the power spectral density (PSD) of weakly stationary processes using the periodogram and FFT.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Periodogram estimation.
  - Understanding the relation between autocovariance and PSD via the Herglotz theorem.
- **Skills Applied**: 
  - Implementation of FFT-based spectral estimators.
  - Analysis of bias and variance of PSD estimators.
  - Application of theoretical relations to real data.

## Lab 3: Voice Synthesis Using AR(p) Processes
- **Objective**: Synthesize and analyze speech signals using autoregressive (AR) models to understand speech generation and its spectral properties.
- **Key Topics**:
  - AR modeling for signal synthesis.
  - Parameter estimation for AR processes.
  - Spectral analysis of synthesized signals.
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Implementation of AR process modeling and synthesis.
  - Analysis of model accuracy in capturing signal dynamics.
  - Use of Python for spectral and temporal signal analysis.
